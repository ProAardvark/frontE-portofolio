          <p>
            As an aspirant frontend developer from Taguig Philippines. I believe
            in building websites to solve problems, help people and that the
            power of the web should be accessible to everyone. Motivated,
            Organized, and a Curious Person.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've been practicing my skills in different Programming languages,
            and eventually, I started getting better in it, and now it's
            something like a daily routine.
